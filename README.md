Hi there 👋, my name is! :smiley:

![portada](portada.jpg)

Looking to pivot to a career in data.
I am currently working very hard learning:
- How to be a Python ninja 🥷
- How to be a samurai in R ⚔️
- How to be a database wizard 🧙‍♂️
- How to be a master of Excel and data visualization 👨‍🏫
- And of course! Statistics and calculus 📈


I speak Spanish and English (I am learning German but I am not fluent yet :disappointed_relieved:).
